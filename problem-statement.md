1- DataGrid cross-site replication - we need the GA release Date for this feature (note this is a highly requested feature from many customers in addition to Santander).
2- RHSSO + DataGrid performance test results (latency, % communication errors, transaction volume (tps)).
3- OpenShift/RHSSO/DataGrid vertical scaling - we need a release date for this functionality (on the roadmap to be included in DataGrid version 8.3).


- TODO
    - Operator Install of RHSSO working with RHDG
    - Operator Install with Postgres RDS
    - REST APIs working with Caches - offline sessions loading problem
    - Database
        - Investigate crossplane.io operator
        Questions - Why are using Postgres DB - AWS RDS and why not Maria DB?
    - Collective uptime
        ????? - why is it an issue?
    - Observability
    - Data Grid
    - Chaos Testing
    - Performance Testing
        - git hub - https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark
        - Performance benchmark numbers are low
